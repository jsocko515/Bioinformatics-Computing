Notes for Exercise 2.1

Question: 

Write a python program to print out the codon for Methionine (aka the start codon) backwards in lower-case symbols.
 - Represent Methionine as string variable codon = "ATG".
 - Use only the techniques shown in lecture.


The method used to solve the exercise:
	
	•In order to reverse the start codon it had to first be disassembled into separate nucleotides. 
		oThe First nucleotide is in the zero index of the start codon. 
		oThe second nucleotide is in the first index of the start codon.
		oThe third nucleotide is in the second index of the stat codon. 
	•After separating the start codon the individual nucleotides are reassembled in the reverse order to represent the reversed start codon. 
		oThe separate nucleotides, which are now all separate string elements, are added in the reverse order to form a new string.
		oEx: third + second + first 
	•Once the start codon is reversed(in a new string), it is changed from lowercase to uppercase.
		oThis is completed by using the .lower() method. 
	•Finally the original start codon, the reversed start codon, and the reversed lowercase start codon are printed out on separate lines. 


Strength and Weakness of the method used:

	•This solution can only take in a string input.
		oThis string can be a combination of letters, numbers, or symbols. 
		oIf the string is a combination of letters, it can be either lowercase or uppercase.
		oThe desired input should be a string of nucleotides (A, T, G ,or C) 
	•Although there is a desired input, the solution will result in an output regardless of the type of string input. This output will not always solve the question at hand.
		oIf a string of lowercase letters is inputted, the output will be the reverse of that string. 
		oIf a string of number is inputted, the output will be the reverse of that string.
		oIf a string of symbols is inputted, the output will be the reverse of that string.
	•When an integer is inputted, a type error occurs because the solution will only take a string type.  
		oTypeError: ‘int’ object is not subscriptable
	•When letters or symbols are inputted without being in a string, a type error will occur because the solution will only take a string. 
	oEx: abc
		TypeError: name object ‘abc’ is not subscriptable

Lessons Learned from writing of this solution:
	•How to disassemble string into separate indices. 
	•How to add separate strings to form a new string. 
	•How to use the .lower() method on strings to change them from uppercase to lowercase.
